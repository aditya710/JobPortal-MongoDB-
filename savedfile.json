Although much work remains to improve the quality, expand the\navailability, and reduce the costs of prosthetic services, the Fund is\nincreasing its involvement in response to other challenges. The\noverwhelming needs of persons requiring wheelchairs is one of those\nchallenges. \nApplicants under this APS should propose innovative ideas that address\nthe physical, social, and/or economic needs of persons requiring\nwheelchairs. Prospective partners could include a wide range of U.S.,\ninternational, and regional organizations such as: private voluntary\norganizations, foundations, colleges and universities, civic groups,\nfaith-based institutions, private businesses and associations,\nphilanthropic organizations, and advocacy groups. The Bureau strongly\nencourages U.S. organizations to collaborate with indigenous\norganizations in their proposals. \nOrganizations should already be registered with USAID. If not already\nregistered, U.S. PVOs can register athttp://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/pvc/regtoc.html, though the process\ncan be time consuming. Eligible Public International Organizations\n(PIOs) can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/ads/300/30851m.pdf.\nHost country-based NGOs should seek to register at the nearest USAID\nMission. \nUSAID encourages qualified applicants to submit thoughtful and\ninnovative approaches that have high potential for successful\nachievement of project objectives. Upon award, grants or cooperative\nagreements will be managed/ monitored by either the DCHA Bureau in\nWashington or field Missions, depending on the scope or nature of the\nproposed activities. \n1. Introduction:  Conservative estimates put the number of people with\ndisabilities in developing countries at close to half a billion. Of\nthese, an estimated twenty million require wheelchairs to be mobile. \nWhile there are many humanitarian and development agencies involved in\nprosthetics/orthotic programs, there are only a few who provide a\ncomprehensive approach to services for those requiring wheelchairs and\nthe associated training and education that must accompany their\nprovision. \nThe statistics are startling: \n- UNESCO estimates that 20 million people in the world need a wheelchair\nthat don't have one; \n- The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by the year 2020\nroad traffic accidents will account for the third highest cause of the\nglobal burden of disease. This is a significant jump from its current\nranking of ninth. Developing countries will be largely responsible for\nthis sharp rise and many survivors may sustain mobility-related\ninjuries; \n- WHO data further suggest that between 20-40 people per million will\nsustain a spinal cord injury in any one year, many of whom will be\nconfined to a wheelchair; \n- The incidence of cerebral palsy in the United States is about 1 in\n93,000. In the developing world, the incidence is near 1 in 400 and many\nwith CP require wheelchairs for mobility; \n- Consensus estimates indicate that 26,000 people are killed or maimed\nby land mines each year. Many of the injured will be wheelchair bound. \nDespite this overwhelming need, only a small percentage of people in the\ndeveloping world are able to obtain an appropriate wheelchair, the\nrequisite training needed to assist them to obtain their maximum\nindependence and functionality, and the opportunities to be contributing\nmembers of their families, communities, and society. \nA wheelchair is more than just an aid to mobility. It can be a means to\nself-sufficiency and increased self-esteem. It can be a vehicle to\nmeaningful employment and contributions to community and society. It\nreduces dependency and the associated burden placed on family and\nfriends. \nSince 1989, the LWVF has invested significant resources in the\ndevelopment and implementation of rehabilitation programs worldwide.\nSeveral of these programs have included relatively minor wheelchair\nprovision and services activities. This APS represents a mechanism to\nexpand the scope of the activities specifically addressing the\ncomprehensive needs of persons requiring wheelchairs. \n2. Background:  Established in 1989, the Leahy War Victims Fund (LWVF),\nadministered by USAID, provides assistance to war victims in developing\ncountries. The Fund provides a dedicated source of financial and\ntechnical assistance for civilian victims of war who suffer from\nmobility-related injuries, including people who suffer from polio as a\nresult from interrupted immunization services. \nIn the past decade, the Fund has devoted the major part of its resources\nto the establishment and improvement of accessible and appropriate\nprosthetic services. This decision was based upon the realization that\nwith its modest resources, the Fund would have the greatest impact on\nthe greatest number of people through the provision of \"unassisted\nmobility.\" The Fund also devotes substantial attention to ensure that\nservice providers incorporate appropriate follow up and monitoring of\nbeneficiaries of services. \nMore recently the Fund has extended its scope selectively in response to\nthe needs of different populations of war victims. For instance, in some\ncountries there is a great need for rapid treatment of victims who\nsuffer general medical trauma from accidental detonation of unexploded\nordinance and less of a need for treatment of mine amputee victims.\nOther LWVF responses include assistance to improve surgical preparation\nfor prosthetic fitting, strengthening organizations that address the\nneeds of PWDs, improved physical and occupational rehabilitation\nservices, and support for innovative approaches to increase\nincome-generating opportunities for war victims. \nThe Leahy War Victims Fund has now provided over $ 90 million in more\nthan 22 countries in support of civilian victims of war. Detailed\ndescriptions of current country initiatives can be found athttp://www.leahywarvictimsfund.org/ Descriptions found at this web site\noutline the scope of activities currently being funded through the Leahy\nWar Victims Fund. \n3. Program Components:  This Annual Program Statement may support\nmultiple activities that will be responsive to critical needs. However,\nLeahy War Victims Fund philosophy must be foundational to the proposal: \nThe LWVF believes that a number of fundamental principles should be\napplied to the development and provision of wheelchairs and wheelchair\nprogramming. \nFirst and foremost, like the provision of prostheses, providing\nwheelchairs is not just about the chair itself. Rather, it is about\nincreasing the quality of a survivor's life through increased mobility,\nindependence and integration into society. When the wheelchair itself is\nthe focus, there is a great temptation for an organization to take a\n\"one size fits all\" approach and mass produce, or collect donated chairs\nand conduct mass deliveries. Not only are these wheelchairs generally\nill-suited to the rough urban and rural environments of low-income\ncountries, but they do not provide long-term solutions, and have in some\ncases, caused the collapse of local wheelchair manufacturing\nenterprises. \nSecond, while numerous non-governmental organizations endeavor to\nprovide wheelchairs, few attempt to establish indigenous wheelchair\nproduction. While shipments of appropriate wheelchairs may provide a\nshort-term benefit to a small group of people, supporting local and\nsmall-scale production of good quality, repairable, and affordable\nchairs in country is better development practice. Similarly, regional\nproduction coupled with local assembly and repair offers opportunities\nfor sustainability. \nThird, the usefulness of a wheelchair is directly related to the\ntraining and expertise of the technician fitting the chair, proper\nassessment and prescription, and basic training in safe and effective\nuse. \nFinally, the provision or use of a wheelchair is only a beginning step\nto enabling a wheelchair user to improve their quality of life and play\na role within their community. Greater investments still need to be made\nin local disabled people's organizations and self-help groups, increased\nopportunities need to be provided to attend school and be active in the\nworkplace, and increased advocacy on a local and national level needs to\ntake place. \n4. Funding Available, Number of Awards and Types of Assistance:  This is\nan open Annual Program Statement (APS) under which USAID solicits\nproposals from organizations that are interested in addressing the\ndiverse needs of people requiring wheelchairs in the developing world.\nProposals will be reviewed by USAID using the process described below. \nFunding Available and Number of Awards: The actual number of awards\nunder this APS is subject to the availability of funds and the viability\nof proposals received. Accordingly, USAID reserves the right to make\nmultiple grants or no awards at all through this APS. LWVF is a\nworldwide program and may fund programs in any of the USAID regions:\nAfrica, Latin American and Caribbean, Europe and Eurasia, and Asia and\nNear East. Preference will be given to applications for programs in\ncountries that already receive USAID funding (disaster or development\nassistance). No award will be made without the concurrence of the USAID\nmission or Embassy in the country under consideration. Subject to the\nforegoing, USAID is planning for a program of up to $5 million over five\nyears, beginning in FY 2003. The Bureau is open to working with both\nlarge and small organizations, organizations with both experience and no\nexperience in working with the U.S. government or USAID. Grant requests\nshould generally range from $50,000 to $500,000 per year. Proposals may\nbe for as little as one year and up to a maximum of five years.\nProposals for less than that amount may be acceptable, but must\ndemonstrate a high priority, as well as targeted, rapid, and lasting\nimpact. \nUSAID shall not be liable for any costs incurred by applicants in\npreparation and submission of concept papers or applications. \nUSAID reserves the right to award cooperative agreements instead of\ngrants if deemed more desirable or appropriate. If USAID elects to award\na cooperative agreement instead of a grant, a cooperative agreement will\npermit the \"substantial involvement\" of USAID in program activities.\nSpecifically, USAID substantial involvement will involve the approval\nof: (a) annual work plans; (b) not more than five (5) key personnel\nappointments; (c) program monitoring and evaluation plans; (d)\nsubcontracts and subagreements and subcontractors/subrecipients; and (e)\nagreement in the selection of advisory committee members, if applicable.\nFinancial reporting will depend on the payment provisions of the\ncooperative agreement(s), which cannot be determined until the\nsuccessful applicant(s) is(are) selected. In no case, however, will\nfinancial reporting be required more frequently than progress reporting.\nSuch reporting will be quarterly, with reports due 30 days after the end\nof each calendar quarter. Final progress reports will be due 90 days\nafter the expiration of the cooperative agreement(s). \n5. Application Process:  Applicants shall submit an original and two (2)\ncopies of the Technical Application and an original and one (1) copy of\nthe Cost Application. An electronic copy of both the technical and cost\napplications must also be provided on a 3.5\" disk (MS Word or Excel\nformat). \nApplications must be submitted in English. Unnecessarily elaborate\nbrochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a\ncomplete and effective application are not desired and may be construed\nas an indication of the prospective recipient's lack of cost\nconsciousness. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper and bindings and\nexpensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor\ndesired. \nApplicants must be submitted in accordance with the requirements set\nforth below: \nApplication Instructions \na. All applications must be in size 12 font, New Times Roman. \nb. The length of the application should not exceed the following page\nlimits: \ni. Cost Application (Standard Form SF-424 and supporting narrative; seehttp://www.usaid.gov/pubs/ads/sfforms.html. No page limit \nii. Technical Application \nExecutive Summary: 2 pages \nBody of Application: 20 page maximum \niii. All Attachments: 10 page maximum \nSuggested Outline for Applications \nThe application should include the following information: \nTable of Contents listing all page numbers and attachments \nI. Executive Summary \nII. Program Description \nA. Goal and Objectives \nB. Background \nC. Identification of Specific Problem(s) to be addressed \nD. Proposed Interventions/Technical Approach and Expected Impact.\nApplications should provide illustrative impact indicators and discuss\nhow results will be sustained or made permanent. \nE. Duration of Activity and Implementation Schedule \nF. Management, Monitoring and Evaluation Plan \nG. Sustainability Plan \nH. Role of USAID, if any (e.g. facilities, equipment, material, or\npersonnel resources) \nI. Appendices \na. Relevant Organizational Experiences \nb. Curricula Vitae for Key Personnel \nApplications should also include the following attachments: \nFinancial Plan/Cost Application \nApplication Form SF-424 \nSummary Budget \nAnnual Budgets \nBudget Notes \nThe attachments may also include relevant information about implementing\npartners, including documentation of their intent to participate. \nApplications must be submitted to the following address: \nMr. Lloyd Feinberg \nDCHA/DG/SPANS Rm. 3.07-10 \nU.S. Agency for International Development \n1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington DC 20523-3100 \nIf applications are hand delivered to USAID/Washington, couriers must\nreport to the building guard at the 14th Street entrance. The guard\ncannot accept applications, but will call DCHA/DG for someone to come to\nthe reception desk and accept the application. The courier must wait\nuntil the DCHA/DG representative arrives to accept the application. It\nis recommend that the applicant contact USAID in advance of any courier\ndelivery to ensure that someone will be available to receive the\napplication, which cannot be left unattended at the guard station.\nElectronic transmittal of the final application (including budget and\nbudget narrative) shall also constitute an official submission, but\nUSAID does not accept any responsibility for delays in transmission or\nreceipt. \nFrom among the applications, USAID will select those that it intends to\nfund and will proceed to negotiate an award with each successful\napplicant subject to the availability of funding. The final decision for\nfunding will be based on both a technical review and the availability of\nUSAID funding. USAID reserves the right to fund one or more or none of\nthe applications that may be submitted. All applications will be\nevaluated according to the criteria below. \nNote that all applicants may be subject to a pre-award financial review.\nFurther, organizations that believe they may not meet USAID's financial\naccountability requirements are encouraged to submit their proposal in\npartnership with eligible U.S. or international, or regional\norganizations that are experienced with these requirements in order to\npromote sustainability of programs after USAID support ends. \n6. Review and Evaluation Process:  USAID will review all applications\nsubmitted prior to COB August 12, 2004 in an initial round of reviews.\nApplications submitted after August 12, 2004 will be reviewed\napproximately on a quarterly basis until January 31, 2005. \nPartner Eligibility Criteria \nPotential partners include: private voluntary organizations,\nfoundations, colleges and universities, civic groups, faith-based\ninstitutions, international organizations, private businesses and\nassociations, regional organizations, philanthropic organizations, and\nadvocacy groups. Potential for-profit applicants should note that USAID\npolicy prohibits the payment of fee/profit to the prime recipient under\ngrants and cooperative agreements. Forgone profit does not qualify as\ncost sharing or leveraging. Note that the preceding list of potential\npartners is for illustrative purposes only, as our criteria for\neligibility are broad. USAID welcomes other, new types of partners. \nUSAID encourages proposals that embrace our Global Development Alliance\n- a USAID initiative that seeks to leverage USG funds by matches from\nprivate sources, preferably not less than 1:1. To be counted as a GDA\ninitiative, there must be a clear expectation that USAID resources will\nbe at least matched one-to-one by all other resources combined, both\npublic (e.g., official, bilateral, multilateral, or governmental) and\nprivate (e.g., from companies, foundations, universities, NGOs, or\nindividuals), so long as private resources equal at least 25% of USAID's\ncontribution. \nApplications are not required to include cost-sharing provisions.\nApplications that include additional in-kind and/or cash contributions\nfrom non-U.S. government sources will, however, be give special\nconsideration since cost sharing demonstrates a strong commitment to the\nproposed program. Cost sharing includes contributions, both cash and\nin-kind, which are necessary and reasonable to achieve program\nobjectives and which are verifiable from the recipient's records. Cost\nsharing contributions may include volunteer services provided by\nprofessional and technical personnel, and un-recovered indirect costs.\nHowever, cost sharing does not include forgone profit. Applicants that\ndo not include such contributions are encouraged to provide a rationale\nfor not doing so. \nProgram Eligibility Criteria \nTo be considered for funding under this APS, proposed programs must meet\nall of the following requirements: \n- Proposals must have clearly-defined objectives that lead to\nempirically verifiable results through an effective methodology \n- Proposals should reflect some combination of the following factors;\nexpertise and/or experience, innovative and new ideas, effective use of\ntechnologies \n- Proposals must address one or more of the priorities and concerns\nlisted earlier in this APS \n- Proposals must offer promise of significant development impact, as\nmeasured, for example, by the number of direct and indirect\nbeneficiaries of the program, and/or by the potential for replication or\nscaling-up over time \n- Proposals must be feasible from a technical, economic, financial, and\nsocial perspective \nSelection Criteria for Applications \nThe criteria listed below will serve as the basis upon which all\napplications will be evaluated. Technical aspects of the applications,\nevaluated according to the criteria below, will constitute 40 points of\nthe total evaluation, and must demonstrate the likelihood that the\nproposed program will be successful in achieving its objectives.\nApplicants' organizational experience, past performance, and quality of\nkey staff will constitute 40 points of the evaluation; this will include\nan assessment of the applicants' ability to achieve expected results\nwithin a reasonable time frame. The remaining 20 points will be based on\nfairness and reasonableness of costs. \n1. Technical Approach - 40 points \nApplications shall have a clear definition of the problem which the\ngrant activity intends to address, supported by reliable data and\nconsultations with the local communities and appropriate host country\norganizations to the extent necessary; clearly define the nature of\nintervention/s that will be provided and strongly establish the\nrelationship of these interventions with defined problem; interventions\nmust focus on problem solving rather than simply problem identification.\nThe application shall have a strong likelihood of appropriate\nsustainability with a sensible scheme for addressing this concern. USAID\nwill look for evidence of broad-based local support, including evidence\nof significant local contributions from participant \"stakeholders\" as\nwell as other entities that are sympathetic with the proposed activity.\nFurther, applications shall have an evaluation and reporting plan\nincorporating such critical elements as: impact indicators,\ngender-disaggregated data collection, monitoring, program audit,\npreparation of financial status reports, and progress reports. USAID\nwill give priority to applications that demonstrate innovative\napproaches in reaching and engaging the participation of target\nbeneficiaries, host country agencies, and other stakeholders as well as\nincorporate, as appropriate, a well defined system for selecting\ndeveloping and strengthening the organizational and management\ncapabilities of local communities and counterpart agencies. \n2. Institutional Qualifications/Past Performance/Personnel - 40 points \nApplications will be evaluated on both past performance as well as\nprogram intentions. Applications should demonstrate a thoroughness and\nunderstanding of management principles, technically sound planning and\noperations management, and the capabilities necessary to successfully\nmanage the program; including USAID regulations. If a sub-grant\nmechanism is proposed, the applicant must demonstrable the ability to\nmanage and implement such a program. Proposed key staff should have\nsuccessful, verifiable, and recent experience and there should be\ndemonstrable experience in developing and sustaining effective,\ncollaborative work with grant stakeholders, other organizations, and\nhost country representatives. Previous experience in the development and\nimplementation of strategies that contribute to the functional\nreintegration of people with disabilities, especially those requiring\nwheelchairs, will be appropriately recognized \n3. Cost Considerations - 20 points \nApplications will be evaluated on both the fairness and reasonableness\nof all proposed costs, cost sharing and the extent to which local buy-in\n(not necessarily financial) is demonstrated. \nUSAID reserves the right to make multiple grants or no awards at all\nthrough this APS. Programs selected for funding will be based on the\nscore of the technical evaluations, evidence or organizational\nresponsibility, USAID priorities, ability and willingness of concerned\nUSAID Missions to award and manage the activity, and the availability of\nfunds. If the results of USAID's assessment are not positive, written\nnotification will be provided to the applicant. If the results are\npositive, the selected organization will be notified. Additional\ninformation and program revisions may be required.\n7.
